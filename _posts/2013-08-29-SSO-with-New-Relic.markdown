{% excerpt %}

A few days ago we released integration between [Auth0](http://developers.auth0.com/newrelic) and [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/auth0). You can now login to New Relic with your Github, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Active Directory or LDAP accounts. [See here for a complete list of supported identity providers in Auth0](http://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders): Consumer and Enterprise.

As with other integrations we have published, setup takes just a few minutes and it is straight-forward:

### Add New Relic from the dashboard:

### Enter your New Relic Account and follow a few simple steps:

Here's a quick end to end demo that shows login into New Relic with a Github account (use full screen):

And the best news: __New Relic integration is free for all our editions.__
