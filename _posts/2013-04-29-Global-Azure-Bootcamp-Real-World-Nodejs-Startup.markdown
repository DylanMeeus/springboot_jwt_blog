### Startup in-a-Box Bootcamp

In partnership with Microsoft, [NXTP Labs](http://www.nxtplabs.com/), [Mural.ly](http://mural.ly) and [Ideame](http://idea.me), [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is very proud to have hosted the the [Global Windows Azure Bootcmap](http://globalwindowsazure.azurewebsites.net) in [Buenos Aires, Argentina](http://azurenodebootcamp.eventbrite.com).

This is an event that happened simultanesouly around the globe in **93 cities**!

Our theme for the event was: __"Startup in-a-box"__. We wanted to share with the community  what we have been using to get our Startup going:  our __tools__, __frameworks__, and  __processes__ that we use daily in our company.

### Some numbers

These are some numbers for the day:

* **40** showed up on Saturday. That's a pretty good turn up of all registered users. Clearly,  there's interest, thanks everyone!
* **Everyone** stayed till 6pm (that is 9 hours of training on a Saturday!)
* Very high level of satisfaction: **90%** of the attendees rated the event gave at the **highest score**.
* **6** presentations and Hands on Labs, covering **node.js, mongodb, Windows Azure, Auth0, GitHub and Jenkins**
* **8** organizers (most of them working on startups) to make sure everyone could get their questions answered:

### Community reaction

Twitter is often a good sensor of how an event is going:

## The Bootcamp content is Open Sourced on GitHub!

The content we delivered on the bootcamp was a mix of 30-minutes presentations, followed by time for practicing the concepts with simple excercises. This content represents what we would have liked to see when we started our companies. It also captures what we've learnt through the last months.

The best content is the one that people actually use and tweak over time. We decided to contribute it to the broader community so it becomes live.

### Our Vision

Argentina has a vibrant entrepeneur community. There are two accelerators and lots of startups.

There's quite a bit of content around the "soft" aspects of building a startup. There are many talks available from successful entrepeneurs, investors. There're meetups on marketing and pitch clinics. There's Palermo Valley. But we felt there were fewer opportunities for technical people to connect and share their experiences.

We often hear questions like:

* What __options__ do I have for storing data?
* What are the __pros/cons__ of each option?
* What are __common mistakes__ people make? How do I __avoid__ them?
* What does your __build environment__ look like?
* What __tools__ you use?
* How to tell whan something is __hype__ or __real__?

Given that last Saturday was such a good experience, we asked ourselves: why not do this more often?

So [stay tuned](http://twitter.com/auth0)...we'll have more news to share with you soon.
