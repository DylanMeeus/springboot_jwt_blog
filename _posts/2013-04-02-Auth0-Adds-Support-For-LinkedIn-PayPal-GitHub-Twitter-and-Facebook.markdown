If your app uses Auth0 for authenticating users, adding SSO with LinkedIn, PayPal, GitHub, Twitter and Facebook is just a click away:

Each provider configuration page will allow you to fine tune the information you'd like your customers to disclose. As an example, when selecting PayPal you can choose to request:

<!-- more -->

Facebook is particularly prolific in profile scopes, but we've added explanations to each one to help you choose the right ones:

Registration of apps with each of these providers is different and sometimes difficult to find online. We've documented all of them, accesible right from each configuration screen:

Here's a list for your reference:

* [Facebook](https://docs.auth0.com/facebook-clientid)
* [LinkedIn](https://docs.auth0.com/linkedin-clientid)
* [GitHub](https://docs.auth0.com/github-clientid)
* [Twitter](https://docs.auth0.com/twitter-clientid)
* [PayPal](https://docs.auth0.com/paypal-clientid)

Finally, the __Auth0 Login Widget__ will show the new connections if you enable them:
