Today we're happy to announce the launch of the **Auth0 Europe** region. Auth0 makes identity simple for tens of thousands of developers in more than 150 countries around the world, and now those topographically closer to Frankfurt can enjoy even lower latency logins.  Further, subscribers everywhere that have the compliance requirement of EU data residence can check that box.

## One Auth0, Two Continents
New subscribers now have the ability to specify their preferred region - Europe or the US - by simply selecting a location when creating their free developer account. Existing subscribers who are currently running from the US region who want to switch can just let us know and we'll handle migration. A number of Auth0 subscribers have already migrated to the European region and have reported a quick and easy transition.

## Faster than ever
Choosing a service region closer to where your customers are operating can mean some pretty awesome improvements in login latency. Subscribers in Europe who are already running from the European region have seen latency improvements of nearly 2x when compared to running from the US region, meaning even faster logins.

## Migration from US
If you’d like to move from the US region to the EU region, simply let us know and we'll migrate your configuration/data. Once done, it’s just a simple change in your application so that it points to `https://<account>.eu.auth0.com`.

## Safe Harbor
Auth0 has always and will continue to comply with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Auth0 has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
