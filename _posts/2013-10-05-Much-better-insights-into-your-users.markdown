We recently released a much improved visualization for Auth0's user log. Auth0 keeps track of many important events related to your users activity: successful logins, unsuccessful attempts, date & time of access, location, OS & browser version, among others.

You can browse all these details under [the users section in the dashboard](https://app.auth0.com/#/users).

Here's a quick demo:

<!-- more -->

The Users section is also the launchpad for a number of actions you can perform:

* Delete a user record
* Block a user
* Login As a user to an application for troubleshooting
* Edit its profile properties

Here's another quick demo:

All this is in production now. Stay tuned for a follow-up post on the Auth0's user store.  Feedback is always welcome. Enjoy!
